The Hobbit house here is an imitation of the one in the Hobbit film or the one in New Zealand. Songgo langit means sky support, this is because in Seribu Baru Songgo Langit there is a hill that seems to be a pillar of the sky.

Yes, Seribu Batu Songgo Langit is the location where there is a Hobbit house in the Mangunan area. The Hobbit house in question is different from the one in New Zealand of course. The Hobbit house here is an imitation of the one in the Hobbit film or the one in New Zealand. Songgo langit means sky support, this is because in Seribu Baru Songgo Langit there is a hill that seems to be a pillar of the sky. Seribu Batu Songgo Langit is a tourist spot in the Dlingo area that offers various tourist attractions, but most of them are photo spots.
