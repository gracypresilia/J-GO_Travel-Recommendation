# Preprocessing Data Steps of J-GO Travel-Recommendation
This step involves preparing the dataset for use in the travel recommendation model by ensuring consistency and readiness for further use in modeling.

## Tools
- **Visual Studi Code**: An IDE for writing, debugging, and running Python scripts in a streamlined development environment.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: A code documentation tool that allows the use of both Markdown for text and Python for coding.

## Python Libraries
- **os**: Library for interacting with the local operating system, including reading raw data files.
- **pandas**: Library for handling and cleaning datasets.
- **GoogleTranslator from deep_translator**: Library for translating textual data to provide dual-language datasets (Bahasa Indonesia and English).

## Process Overview
1. **Read Raw Datasets**: Ensure data can be accessed and understand its content to avoid errors in usage.
2. **Preprocess Each Dataset**: Ensure each dataset is consistent and usable before merging.
3. **Merge Cleaned Datasets**: Combine cleaned datasets to ensure a comprehensive and consistent dataset for subsequent processes.
4. **Preprocess Merged Dataset**: Clean the merged dataset to ensure consistency and readiness for modeling.
5. **Export the Preprocessed Data**: Prepare the data for use in a machine learning model.
